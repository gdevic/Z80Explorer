## Compiling from sources

The application is built on the Qt framework.

* On Windows, install MS Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition. On Linux, use gcc
* Install Qt 6.9.0 framework (with support for x64 MS Visual Studio 2022 on Windows)
* Compile with QtCreator selecting the “Release” build

On Linux, follow the guide here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/linux.html
* sudo apt-get install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev

## Compiling zmac assember on Linux

If you are going to compile and run Z80 test programs, you need zmac assembler. Download it from here: http://48k.ca/zmac.html<br>
I am not aware of a prebuilt binary for Linux, but it is fairly easy to build since the source is available at that site. You may also need:
* sudo apt-get install bison
