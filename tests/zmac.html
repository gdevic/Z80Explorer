<H3>Overview of zmac</H3>
zmac is a Z-80 macro cross-assembler. It has all the features you'd
expect. It assembles the specified input file (with a '.z' extension
if there is no pre-existing extension and the file as given doesn't
exist) and produces program output in many different <A HREF="#format">formats</A>.
It also produces a nicely-formatted
listing of the machine code and cycle counts alongside the source
in a ".lst" file.
<P>
To reduce clutter and command line option usage, by default all zmac output is put
into an (auto-created) <TT>zout</TT> subdirectory.  For <TT>file.z</TT> the listing
will be in <TT>zout/file.lst</TT>, the TRS-80 executable format in <TT>zout/file.cmd</TT>
and so on.  For more friendly usage in make files and integrated development
environments the <TT>-o</TT>, <TT>--oo</TT>, <TT>--xo</TT> and <TT>--xd</TT> options may be used to select
sepcific output file formats and where they are written.
<P>
<A HREF="#undoc">Undocumented</A> Z-80 instructions are supported as well as 8080 code.
<P>
zmac strives to be a powerful assembler with expressions familiar to C
programmers while providing good backward compatibility with original
assemblers such as Edtasm, MRAS and Macro-80.

<H3>Input Format</H3>
<P>
zmac uses the standard Zilog mnemonics, and the pseudo-ops are also
largely as you'd expect.
<P>
A "<TT>.</TT>" may optionally preceeed any psuedo-op.
For example, "<TT>.org</TT>" and "<TT>org</TT>" are treated as equivalent.
<P>
Input can be upper or lowercase.
<P>
Comments start with <TT>;</TT> and carry on to the end of the line.
<P>
Number constants can take a trailing h or a leading $ or 0x for hex,
a trailing b for binary, a trailing o or q for octal, or a trailing
d for decimal.
<P>
<TT>'LH'</TT> (any length 2 string) can be treated as a number whose value
is <TT>'H'</TT> * 256 + <TT>'L'</TT>.
<P>
Labels are declared with <TT>label:</TT> or just <TT>label</TT> - indentation is unimportant.
Labels can be up to 40 chars long.  They can start with and contain 
letters, digits, <TT>$</TT>, <TT>.</TT>, <TT>?</TT>, <TT>@</TT> and _.  Ambiguous identifiers like
<TT>$FCB</TT> will be treated as hex constants unless defined as a label.  Labels
declared with two colons (<TT>label::</TT>) make the label public.
<P>
Single quotes are ignored at the end of identifiers allowing non-binding
<A HREF="#prime">notation</A> indicating alternate register use during heavy applications
of <TT>exx</TT> and <TT>ex</TT>.
<P>
Here is how other things work.  Numbers are used as examples, but a full
<A HREF="#expr">expression</A> can be used in their place.
<P>
<H4>Data</H4>
<P>
<TT>defb 42</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A byte.  <TT>ascii</TT>, <TT>byte</TT>, <TT>db</TT>, <TT>defm</TT>, <TT>dm</TT> and <TT>text</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defb 'foobar'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>An ASCII character string (not NUL-terminated).
Double quotes can also be used.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defb 'Who needs anything more than CP/M?',13,10,'$'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Strings and bytes can mix together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defw 2112</TT>
<P>
<TT>defw $123,0x456</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A word (16 bits).  <TT>word</TT> and <TT>dw</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defd $12345678</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A double word (32 bits). <TT>dword</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>defs 500</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Skip output ahead 500 bytes.  This will insert 500 zeros in the ".ams"
and ".cim" output files or if inside a ".phase" section.
<TT>block</TT>, <TT>ds</TT> and <TT>rmem</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dc 'string'</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>ascii</TT> but accepts only a single string and the high bit of the
last character will be set. <TT>bytes</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dc count,value</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Repeat the byte <TT>value</TT> a total of <TT>count</TT> times.  Similar to <TT>defs</TT>
except that memory is always filled with <TT>value</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>incbin file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inserts the raw contents of the file into the assembly.  Simpler for
large amounts of data.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Symbols</H4>
<P>
<TT>label equ 100</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Define a symbol to have a fixed value.  The symbol can be used before it
is defined.  A symbol defined with <TT>equ</TT> or as a label can be defined only
once, except that a symbol defined with <TT>equ</TT> may be redefined to the
same value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>varname defl 200</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Define a symbol to have a changeable value.  The symbol cannot be used
before it is defined, and it can be redefined to a different value later
with another <TT>defl</TT>. <TT>aset</TT>, <TT>set</TT> and <TT>=</TT> are synonyms (despite <TT>set</TT>
also being a Z-80 mnemonic).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>varname OP = expression</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Shorthand for <TT>varname defl varname OP expression</TT>.  Allows for C-like
handling of variable such as <TT>var += 5</TT>.  <TT>OP</TT> can be <TT>+</TT>, <TT>-</TT>, <TT>*</TT>, <TT>/</TT>,
<TT>%</TT>, <TT>&amp;</TT>, <TT>|</TT>, <TT>^</TT>, <TT>&lt;&lt;</TT>, <TT>&gt;&gt;</TT>, <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> or <TT>||</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>varname--</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Shorthand for <TT>varname defl varname - 1</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>min</TT>
<P>
<TT>max</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as <TT>defl</TT> except that the symbol is defined as the
smaller or bigger of two comma-separated expressions.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>*mod</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Increment the internal module name string.  The first time this results
in "a".  Then "b", "c", ... "z".  Then "aa", "ab", "ac", etc. all the way
up to "zzzz".  The module name string is used in <TT>--mras</TT> mode where "?" in
label names is replaced with the current module name.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>extern lab1,lab2,...</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The listed labels are defined in an external module for later linking.
No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
<TT>ext</TT> and <TT>extrn</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>public lab1,lab2,...</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The given labels will be visible to external modules when linking.
No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
<TT>global</TT> and <TT>entry</TT> are synonyms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>label ++</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Equivalent to <TT>label defl label + 1</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>label --</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Equivalent to <TT>label defl label - 1</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>label += 10</TT>
<P>
<TT>label -= 10</TT>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Equivalent to <TT>label defl label + 10</TT> and <TT>label defl label - 10</TT> respectively.
Also works for <TT>*=</TT>, <TT>/=</TT>, <TT>%=</TT>, <TT>|=</TT>, <TT>&amp;=</TT>, <TT>^=</TT>, <TT>&lt;&lt;=</TT> and <TT>&gt;&gt;=</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Location Control</H4>
<P>
<TT>org 9000h</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the address to assemble to 0x9000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>phase address</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Continue to produce code and data for loading at the current address
but assemble instructions and define labels as if they originated at
the given address.  Useful when producing code that will be copied to
a different location before being executed (e.g., an overlay).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>dephase</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>End <TT>phase</TT> mode assembly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>aseg</TT>
<TT>cseg</TT>
<TT>dseg</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Switch to the absolute, code and data segments respectively.
No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>common /name/</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the address to the start of the selected common block.  The blank
common block will be selected if name is empty or all blanks or
omitted entirely.
No effect unless zmac is producing ".rel" output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Input Control</H4>
<P>
<TT>end</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ends the input.  Any lines after an <TT>end</TT> are silently ignored.
If an arg is given, it declares the entry address for the program.
This has no effect in ".cim" output. In ".hex" output
it generates an S-record directing 0 bytes of data to be loaded
at the given address.  It is required for ".500.cas", ".1000.cas"
and ".1500.cas" output.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>if</TT> ... [ <TT>else</TT> ... ] <TT>endif</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For conditional assembly. If you do <TT>if foo</TT> and <TT>foo</TT> evaluates to
zero, all the lines up until the next corresponding <TT>else</TT> or <TT>endif</TT>
are completely ignored.  Conversely, if <TT>foo</TT> evaluates to non-zero, any
lines from a corresponding <TT>else</TT> to the <TT>endif</TT> are ignored.  Ifs can
be nested.  <TT>cond</TT>/<TT>endc</TT> are synonyms for <TT>if</TT>/<TT>endif</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ifdef symbol</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>if</TT>, but tests if <TT>symbol</TT> has been defined.  Declaring a symbol
as external counts as it being defined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ifndef symbol</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>if</TT>, but tests if <TT>symbol</TT> has not yet been defined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>import file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>include</TT> but will only bring in the file once.  File tracking is done
using only the file name so, for example, an <TT>import file</TT> will stop
both <TT>import ./file</TT> and <TT>import dir/file</TT> even if they actually refer to
different files.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>include file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Include a file. Like C's (well, cpp's) #include and follows the same
include path search rules, but the filename arg
lacks the angle brackets or quotes (though single or double quotes may be used).
<TT>read</TT> is a synonym.  <TT>*include file</TT> also works if started in the first
column.  In <TT>--mras</TT> mode <TT>".asm"</TT> will be added if <TT>file</TT> has
no suffix.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>maclib file</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like <TT>include</TT> but adds <TT>.lib</TT> to the file name so includes <TT>file.lib</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>comment X</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Suspend assembly until the next occurence of character <TT>X</TT> on a line.
The rest of the line will be ignored.  A multi-line comment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>assert expr</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Stop assembly if <TT>expr</TT> is non-zero.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Cycle Counting</H4>
<P>
<TT>sett expr</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the current T-state count to <TT>expr</TT>. <TT>tstate</TT> is a synonym.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>setocf expr</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the current opcode fetch count to <TT>expr</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Code Generation</H4>
<P>
<TT>8080</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make cycle counting operators return 8080 cycle counts and
interpret any ambiguous assembly statements as Intel 8080 mnemonics.
<TT>CP</TT> will be interpreted as "call on positive" and <TT>JP</TT> as "jump on positive".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>z80</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make cycle counting operators return Z-80 cycle counts and
interpret any ambiguous assembly statements as Zilog Z-80 mnemonics.
<TT>CP</TT> will be interpreted as "compare accumulator" and <TT>JP</TT> as "jump unconditionally".
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>jperror enable</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If <TT>enable</TT> is non-zero, turn on errors when <TT>JR</TT> instructions could be used
instead of <TT>JP</TT>, off otherwise.  Used to check existing code for situations
where shorter code could be generated.  Same as <TT>-J</TT> option.
No effect if in 8080 mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>jrpromote enable</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If <TT>enable</TT> is non-zero, <TT>JR</TT> and <TT>DJNZ</TT> instructions will be promoted to
equivalent <TT>JP</TT> and <TT>DEC&nbsp;B</TT>, <TT>JP&nbsp;NZ</TT> instructions if the relative branch
offset is out of range.  If <TT>enable</TT> is zero, promotion is disabled.
Same as the <TT>-j</TT> option.
No effect if in 8080 mode.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Undocumented <A NAME="undoc">Instructions</A></H4>
<P>
Most Z-80 chips support a number of undocumented instructions that were part of
the original design but not made an offical part of the Zilog specification.
These instructions may not be supported by all Z-80 chips, especially
licensed variants, but are fairly widely available nonetheless.
<P>
<TT>sl1 r</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as <TT>sla r</TT> but shifts a 1 into the lower bit of <TT>r</TT> rather than a 0.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>in (c)</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inputs a byte from port <TT>c</TT> but does not store the value.  Flags are still
set as with the normal <TT>in r,(c)</TT> instruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>out (c),0</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Outputs a zero to port <TT>c</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>bit/set/res n,(ix+d),r</TT>
<P>
<TT>rlc/rrc/rl/rr/sla/sl1/sra/srl (iy+d),r</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Same as the corresponding operation on just <TT>(ix+d)</TT> or <TT>(iy+d)</TT> but with
the result being stored both into <TT>(ix+d)</TT> and register <TT>r</TT>.  Except for <TT>bit</TT>
which has no effect on <TT>r</TT>. zmac supports the syntax to allow those
instruction patterns to be generated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The upper and lower bytes of the <TT>ix</TT> and <TT>iy</TT> can be used in a number of
instructions much in the same way as <TT>d</TT> and <TT>e</TT> correspond to the upper and
lower bytes of <TT>de</TT>.  zmac names these <TT>ixh</TT>, <TT>ixl</TT>, <TT>iyh</TT> and <TT>iyl</TT> and
are referred to generically as <TT>ixylh</TT> here.
<P>
<TT>inc/dec/add/adc/sub/sbc/and/xor/or/cp ixylh</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Arithmetic or logical operation on <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ld a/b/c/d/e,ixylh</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Load register with <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>ld ixylh,a/b/c/d/e</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Load <TT>ix</TT> or <TT>iy</TT> high or low byte with register.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>pfix</TT>
<P>
<TT>pfiy</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Output $DD and $FD prefix bytes.  The Z-80 allows multiple prefix bytes
for IX and IY instructions.  This allows you to specify them abstractly.
There is little purpose except for delaying an interrupt or confusing
disassemblers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Miscellaneous</H4>
<P>
<TT>pragma str ...</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Like C's #pragma, a generic hook for special purpose operations.  Only two
are currently defined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>pragma bds rest-of-line</TT> to
output <TT>rest-of-line</TT> to the <TT>.bds</TT> output file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>pragma mds rest-of-line</TT> to
output <TT>rest-of-line</TT> to the <TT>.mds</TT> output file.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <TT>.bds</TT> output format supports setting initial values for Z-80 registers
and I/O ports so <TT>pragma</TT> gives you access to that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <TT>.mds</TT> output format is a MAME debug script thus additional initial
debugging commands may be output.  Of particular use on the TRS-80 Model II
is <TT>pragma mds ib@$ff=1</TT> which maps page 1 of RAM into $8000 .. $FFFF
and thus allows programs to load into that area.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>name str</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set the name of the output module to <TT>str</TT>.  For compatibility reasons
<TT>str</TT> may be parenthesized (e.g., "<TT>name ('foo')</TT>").  Not all output
formats support an internal name and many have severe length limits.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>rsym</TT> and <TT>wsym</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Read/write a symbol file. These simply load/save the currently defined
symbols from/to the file specified (in a non-portable format). <TT>rsym</TT>
takes place at the point it is encountered in the file (on the first
pass); <TT>wsym</TT> is delayed until assembly has finished.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H4>Listing Pseudo-ops</H4>
<P>
There are several pseudo-ops for controlling the listing. None of
these ops appear in the listing themselves:
<P>
<TT>eject</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Start a new listing page.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>nolist</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do nothing. This can be used to have a comment in the source but not
the listing, I suppose.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>elist</TT>, <TT>flist</TT>, <TT>glist</TT>, <TT>mlist</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>These have the same effect as the similarly-named command-line
options, though possibly with the sense reversed depending on the
default. Use an arg &gt;0 (or no arg) to enable, and an arg &lt;0 to
disable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>list arg</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Turns output to listing file (.list) off if <TT>arg</TT> &lt; 0 or on if <TT>arg</TT> &gt; 0.
If no <TT>arg</TT> supplied then listing is enabled.
Use this to avoid listing certain parts of the source.
In <TT>--mras</TT> mode <TT>arg</TT> must be either <TT>on</TT> or <TT>off</TT> and
<TT>*list</TT> can be used if started in the first column.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>title</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Set title (used in listing and symbol file).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<TT>space arg</TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Output arg blank lines in the listing, or one line if no arg is given.

Here is the complete list of operators, highest-precedence first.
Operators separated only by a space are synonyms; for example, <TT>~</TT>
is the same as <TT>not</TT>.

You can use normal parentheses or square brackets to override
the precedence rules. Square brackets can be used where parentheses would
conflict with Z-80 mnemonic syntax, but this is not necessary in any
practical case.
<P>
The <TT>?</TT> may need spaces around it to distinguish it from a label that
has <TT>?</TT> in it.

<H3>Macros</H3>
The following defines a macro named m with zero or more formal parameters
<TT>p1</TT>, <TT>p2</TT>, ..., <TT>pn</TT>, zero or more local symbols <TT>?s1</TT>, <TT>?s2</TT>, ..., <TT>?sm</TT>,
and body <TT>b1</TT>, <TT>b2</TT>, ...:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>m macro p1, p2, ..., pn, ?s1, ?s2, ..., ?sm</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b1</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endm</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
The macro is called by writing:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>m v1, v2, ..., vn</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A macro call expands to the text of the macro's body, with each 
occurrence of a formal parameter <TT>pk</TT> replaced by the corresponding 
value <TT>vk</TT>, and with each local symbol <TT>?sk</TT> replaced by a new, unique 
symbol invented for this call.  Invented symbols begin with <TT>?</TT>,
so you should avoid using such symbols elsewhere in your program.
<P>
zmac currently does not check that you have provided the right number 
of parameters when calling a macro.  If you provide too few, unmatched 
formals are replaced with the empty string.  If you provide too 
many, the additional values begin to replace local symbols as if 
they were ordinary parameters.  (This could be considered a feature.)  
After the local symbols are all replaced, additional parameters 
are silently ignored.
<P>
For compatibility with Macro-80, the first line of a macro definition can
list other labels that will be treated locally:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;local lab1,lab2,...</TT>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Each time the macro is expanded the local labels are replaced with unique
names thus avoiding multiple definition problems.
<P>
For compatability with MRAS, macro arguments may be preceeded by <TT>#</TT>
in their definition and use.
<P>
Any <TT>`</TT> (backquote) in a macro is ignored thus allowing a macro to
construct identifiers.  For example:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>move macro dir</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ld`dir`r</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endm</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Invoking <TT>move i</TT> will construct a <TT>ldir</TT> block move instruction.
<P>
For compatibility, <TT>&amp;</TT> can also be used as in MAC to concatenate
macro parameters.  This conflicts with zmac's bitwise and operator but
you can use the <TT>and</TT> synonym in macros to avoid the conflict.
<P>
In <TT>--mras</TT> mode arguments will be expanded even if they are inside other
identifiers.  The <TT>move</TT> could be written:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>move macro dir</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lddirr</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endm</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Macro definitions can contain macro definitions which will be defined
when the outer macro is first exapnded.  Macros can be redefined as
well.
<P>
Macro expansion continues to the <TT>endm</TT> directive but can be stopped
prematurely by the <TT>exitm</TT> directive.  Typically the <TT>exitm</TT> is inside
some conditional part of the macro.
<P>
Parameters passed to a macro can be empty and are tested with the <TT>nul</TT>
operator:
<P>
<TABLE>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>if nul &amp;par</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>...</TT> </PRE></TD><TD> </TD></TR>
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP"><PRE><TT>endif</TT> </TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
Macro parameters can contain commas if grouped inside <TT>&lt;</TT> and <TT>&gt;</TT>.
Or a comma can be escaped with <TT>^</TT> which can also escape spaces and other
special characters.  It is also be put in front of a macro parameter
name inside the expansion to suppress the replacement by its value.
<P>
Expansion of parameters in a macro body is purely textual.  This can
lead to surprises in complex situations.  The <TT>%</TT> character can be used
to force a macro parameter to be replaced with the evaluation of it
as an expression.
<P>
<P>
<H4>Inline Macros</H4>
<P>
zmac supports the commonly available <TT>rept</TT>, <TT>irp</TT> and <TT>irpc</TT> inline macros
<P>
<TT>rept</TT> repeats its block the given number of times.  This will output 10
<TT>nop</TT> instructions:

<P>
<TT>irpc</TT> runs through a string of letters assigned them to a variable and
expanding the macro block each time.  For example, this will load 7 into

<H3>Compatibility</H3>
<P>
zmac is broadly compatible with many original Z-80 and 8080 assemblers
because it accepts many different names for common operations and has
liberal identifier and numeric formats.  It also accepts most simple
usage of macros.
<P>
When assembling old code keep these portability problems in mind.
<P>
Expression order of evaluation may be different.  zmac uses C semantics
more order of evaluation but assemblers often used simple left to right
ordering.  zmac will evaluate <TT>2+2*3</TT> as <TT>8</TT> where other assemblers will
yield <TT>12</TT>.  However, in <TT>--mras</TT> mode expressions are evaluated strictly
left-to-right for compatibility.
<P>
zmac has no support operating on strings in macros.  Assemblers like Macro-80
could perform conditional tests on strings.
<P>
Advanced macros are unlikely to work.  zmac hasn't advanced to the state where
all the possible ways of substituting parameters are supported.
<P>
Consult the original assembler manual.  zmac error messages won't help you
figure out what an unknown assembler command is supposed to do.
<P>
Compare against original output.  The very safest thing to do when porting
assembly code is to compare the binary output of zmac against that produced
by the original assembler.  This way you can ensure everything has been
interpreted correctly.  Only once that has been achieved should you modify
the code.
<HR>
<H3>Errors and Warnings</H3>
<P>
Any errors or warnings encountered during assembly are reported to standard
error and in the listing file.  The errors output immediately give the source
file and line number containing the error.  In listings the error letter
and message appear just after the line containing the error.

<H3>Output <A NAME="format">Formats</A></H3>
<P>
Except for ".rel", zmac writes every known output when assembling by default.
This is no burden on modern computers and saves having to meticulously select
the desired output format.
<P>
".rel" is a special case since that format is intended for linking and
can have undefined external symbols which would be errors in the other formats.
Conversely, a simple "org $8000" will be an error for ".rel" output as it
defaults to the code segment where absolute origin statements are forbidden.
<P>
If ".rel" is selected for output either by <TT>--relopt</TT> or with
<TT>--oo rel</TT> or <TT>-o file.rel</TT> then all other output formats are suppressed
(except the ".lst" source file listing).

In the symbol table listing, the <TT>=</TT> prefix is given for those symbols
defined by <TT>equ</TT> or <TT>defl</TT>.  The <TT>/</TT> prefix is shown for common blocks.
<P>
The <TT>.rel</TT> file format can store symbol names of up to 7 characters in length.
However, MACRO-80 truncates symbols to 6 characters so that it has one
character in reserve for extending linking operations such as subtracting
two externals from each other.  To be compatible (and sensible), <TT>--rel</TT>
truncates externals to 6 characters.  For MRAS compatibility, <TT>--mras</TT>
truncates symbols to 7 characters.  This is not a problem for MRAS as it
doesn't support extended linking.  But necessary if you want zmac to produce
<TT>.rel</TT> files that will link with MRAS generated <TT>.rel</TT> files.  The <TT>--rel7</TT>
option sets symbol truncation to 7 characters so you can assemble files
that will link with MRAS output.  However, it will break extended linking
on labels longer than 6 characters.
<P>
The <A NAME="prime">ignoring</A> of single quotes can be handy for tracking alternate
register usage.  Consider the following code fragment:
